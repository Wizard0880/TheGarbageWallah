## Introduction

The Garbage Wallah is an innovative project aimed at managing waste efficiently. This repository contains the frontend code for the project, which is built using modern web technologies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm).
- You have a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) client installed.
- You have a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Installation

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Wizard0880/TheGarbageWallah.git

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd TheGarbageWallah/frontend
    ```
3. **Install the dependencies:**
